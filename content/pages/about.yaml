      - paragraphs:
          - "I'm a fast learner. Though my background is in design I always had nack for the technical as well.

I found a new passion in front-end development, and the rest is history."
          - "I got my first taste of the tech field when I signed up for Advanced Chemistry during my junior year of high school. By some typo, or providence ;) I was mistakenly placed into Graphic Design."

          - "I enjoy smoking good tobacco from a pipe."
